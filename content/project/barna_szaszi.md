As an economist and psychologist, his primary goal is to understand how to support vulnerable people to make better decisions. Accordingly, He investigates (a) how the interaction of thinking dynamics and individual differences lead to suboptimal decision making (b) how deprived economic position (perceived or real) deteriorates decision making, how to design environments which create more equality. He is also inerested in how psychological science can be improved.
